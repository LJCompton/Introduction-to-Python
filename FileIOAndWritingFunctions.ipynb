    "* Check your function works by calling it with a list variable and checking the list has been multiplied afterwards\n",
    "* Create a new function called `list_multiply2` that is a copy of `list_multiply1`\n",
    "* Change your `list_multiply2` function to make the second argument have a default value of `9`\n",
    "* Change your `list_multiply2` function so that it doesn't alter the list it's given but **returns a copy** of the list that has been multiplied\n",
